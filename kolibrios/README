This is the port for KolibriOS for Netsurf.

Attempts to make a GUI using boxLIB and using http.obj for network tasks
instead of libcurl.

Let's see where this leads us!

Once the GUI is up, the makefiles need to be patched for netsurf build 
system.

Once that is done, the toolchain from $MENUETDEV needs to be used for 
building.

Once that's finished, we should be good to go!
