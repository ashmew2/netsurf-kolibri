This is the port for KolibriOS for Netsurf.

Attempts to make a GUI using boxLIB and using http.obj for network tasks
instead of libcurl.

Let's see where this leads us!

Once the GUI is up, the makefiles need to be patched for netsurf build 
system.

Once that is done, the toolchain from $MENUETDEV needs to be used for 
building.

Once that's finished, we should be good to go!

---------------------------

For making changes to the GUI :

Edit the guitest.c file using the KolibriOS functions and events from sysfuncs.txt

Once you are done, make it using

make

in the same directory.

If there are no syntax errors in the code, it will give you a file called _gui.

Transfer _gui to KolibriOS and run it to see your changes!

Also, you need to set up $MENUETDEV and point to correct path on Linux machine.
